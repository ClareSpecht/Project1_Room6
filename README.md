Georgia Tech Data Analytics Bootcamp Project 

Ipo advisory firm 

We are an IPO advisory firm that consults clients on both ideal target industries as well as advise on the valuation therein.

Project description 
We were tasked with understanding the trends of companies that went public in the last 3 years. We analyzed who these companies were, what they did, their size and where they were located. We used stock analysis and polygon.io data bases to collect the information. Stock analysis provided us with a list of the companies that went public, their IPO, their symbol, and the listed Date, where as polygon.io provided an extensive data frame, with more information for each company; supported through an API. 

Based on this information, the analysis will be used to make decisions as to what companies to acquire.

Limitations 

Time and cost for full API services were the limitations we faced. The ones that were in our budget had severe time limitations for API calls so we could only a limited amount of information.

Conclusion
Most of the IPO’s were launched in 2021. The successful IPO’s were smaller companies with employees less than 100. The companies launched were mainly located in California and New York and finally our team recommends purchasing an Insurance company.
